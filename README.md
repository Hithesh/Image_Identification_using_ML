# Image_Identification_using_ML
Image Identification ML model involving data preparation, network design, training with backpropagation, and performance evaluation. The project focuses on selecting suitable datasets and tuning neural network parameters. Additionally, implemented data augmentation techniques to further improve the model robustness and generalization capabilities.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluating a machine learning model. The notebook walks through the steps of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## File Structure

- `Model.ipynb` â€” Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.

##  Features

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualization of results  
- Built using popular Python libraries  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name'''bash
###2. Set up the environment
'''bash
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended), then install the required libraries.

Using requirements.txt:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is not available, manually install:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. Run the notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
